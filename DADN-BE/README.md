This is simple task for implement REST API using prisma
1 - Install all dependencies by the command "npm install"
2 - Change the configuration in .env including USER_NAME, PASSWORD and DB_NAME. You can run on your own server in the case of my server is collapsed.
3 - Open your terminal, navigate to the right directory. Using this command "npx prisma migrate dev --name init" will public the database.
4 - Then using the command "npx prisma studio". You can checkout the tables and records in each table.
5 - You can check API by using Postman or equivalent application

Due to time constraints, the database schema may not be fully optimized. Thought I have tried my best to finish it but design a good database schema is not easy. Please consider my effort
